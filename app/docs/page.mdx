```
&description \ text&
```

## Content/Text Area

Provides a larger text area for content.

```
&description \ content&
```

## Number

Allows input of a number. Only difference from text is that it will only allow numbers. Provides checks for min and max values.

```
&description \ number&
&description \ number \ default value&
&description \ number \ default value \ min value \ max value&
```

## Select

Provides a drop down menu for selection. There is no limit to the number of values.

```
&description \ select \ value 1 \ value 2 \ value 3 \ ...&
```

## Group

Groups multiple inputs together. This is useful for grouping multiple inputs together as a single category for the user. Supports nesting.

Requires a `&end&` tag to close the group.

```
&description \ group&
content in here is grouped together
&description \ end&
```

Can also be used for repeated inputs.

```
&description \ group \ repeat&
content in here is grouped together and can be repeated to user's desire
&description \ end&
```
